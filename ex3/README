# Image Processing - Exercise 3
Hybrid Images and Pyramidal Blending

Author: Agam Hershko
Course: Image Processing
Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy

## Description

This project implements two techniques in image processing:

1. Hybrid Images – Combining the low-frequency content of one image with the high-frequency content of another.
2. Pyramidal Blending – Seamlessly blending two images using Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids.

Both techniques are used to manipulate visual perception and create advanced image compositions.

## Contents

- hybrid_image.py: Implementation of hybrid image creation.
- pyramid_blending.py: Implementation of pyramidal blending.
- utils.py: Utility functions for filtering and pyramid construction.
- main.py: Example usage of both algorithms.
- images/: Folder with input and output images.

## How to Run

1. Install required packages:

   pip install numpy opencv-python scipy

2. Run hybrid image script:

   python main.py --mode hybrid

3. Run pyramid blending script:

   python main.py --mode blend

You can change input images and parameters by modifying the code in main.py.
