Image Processing - Exercise 2
Agam Hershko

Overview
This assignment focuses on audio signal processing and is divided into three main tasks:

Task 1: Adding Watermarks
In this task, I added two types of watermarks to audio files:

* Good Watermark: Imperceptible to the human ear.
* Bad Watermark: Clearly audible.

I used STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform) to handle non-stationary signals and embed frequency-domain modifications. Specifically:

* The bad watermark was added at 10,000 Hz, a frequency within the human hearing range, resulting in a 
noticeable buzz.
* The good watermark was added at 18,000 Hz, which is at the edge of human hearing, making it inaudible but 
  visible on a spectrogram.

Watermarks were embedded by boosting the magnitude of specific frequency bins and reconstructing the signal with ISTFT.


Task 2: Classifying Watermarks
Here, I classified 9 audio files into 3 groups based on the watermarks they contained. Each watermark was a sinusoidal modulation of amplitude in the frequency domain (between 16,000–20,000 Hz). The classification was based on the period of the watermark’s sinusoid, determined using spectrogram analysis and time-interval calculations.

The sinusoidal watermark functions were approximately:
* Group 1 (Files 2.0–2.2): f(t) = 2000 * sin(0.46t)
* Group 2 (Files 2.3–2.5): f(t) = 2000 * sin(0.61t)
* Group 3 (Files 2.6–2.8): f(t) = 2000 * sin(0.76t)
Spectrograms and STFT analysis helped identify these patterns by locating peaks around 20 kHz.


Task 3: Tempo Change Detection
This part involved analyzing two audio files:

* One file was time-scaled (stretched).

* One was frequency-scaled (resampled).

Using STFT and visual inspection:

* The first file had reduced frequency range and increased amplitude — indicating time-domain stretching.

* The second file maintained pitch but had a shorter duration — suggesting frequency-domain acceleration.

A watermark in both files further helped compute the scaling factor. By comparing the frequency shift (e.g., 20 kHz in the second file became 5 kHz in the first), I determined the time-stretch factor was approximately x = 4.

Techniques Used
* STFT/ISTFT: For non-stationary signal analysis.

* Spectrograms: Visual representation of frequency content.

* Fourier Transform Manipulations: For watermark embedding and detection.

* Signal Classification: Based on periodicity in frequency-domain patterns.

* Tempo Change Detection: Using comparative spectrogram and watermark analysis.

Key Learnings:

1. Spectrograms and STFT are critical tools for analyzing time-frequency behavior in audio.

2. Non-stationary signal handling is essential for real-world audio tasks.

3. Understanding time vs. frequency domain effects is key to decoding audio manipulations.

4. Embedding and detecting watermarks must balance imperceptibility and robustness.
