# Image Processing Course Projects – 67829
**Author:** Agam Hershko

This repository contains five projects completed as part of the Image Processing course (67829) at The Hebrew
 University of Jerusalem. Each project explores a different concept in signal or image processing using
 Python. The code, notebooks, reports, and results are organized in separate folders.

---

## 📁 Project 1 – Scene Cut Detection
Detects scene transitions (cuts) in grayscale video using histogram analysis.

- Works on two types of videos: with static scenes or with lighting/blur changes.
- Uses cumulative grayscale histograms to detect the most significant change between frames.
- Outputs the frame index where a cut is detected.

🔧 Requirements: `mediapy`, `Pillow`, `numpy`
📄 Includes: `detect_cut.py`, sample videos, and explanation

## 📁 Project 2 – Audio Watermarking & Tempo Detection
Focuses on audio signal processing through 3 tasks:

1. **Adding Watermarks**: Embeds both audible and inaudible frequency signals in audio.
2. **Watermark Classification**: Groups audio files based on periodic patterns in the frequency domain.
3. **Tempo Detection**: Analyzes stretched or resampled audio using watermark shifts.

- Uses STFT and spectrograms to visualize and analyze audio.
- Identifies manipulation based on frequency changes.

📄 Includes: audio samples, STFT code, classification logic, and detailed analysis

## 📁 Project 3 – Hybrid Images & Pyramidal Blending
Combines images using frequency-based techniques:

- **Hybrid Images**: Merges low frequencies from one image with high frequencies from another.
- **Pyramidal Blending**: Smoothly blends two images using Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids.

- Great for visual illusions or seamless editing.
- Easy to tweak and visualize.

🔧 Requirements: `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `scipy`
📄 Includes: `main.py`, blending scripts, utils, and image examples

---

## 📁 Project 4 – Stereo Mosaicing (Panoramas from Video)
Creates panoramic images from input videos.

- Supports dynamic scenes (with motion) and viewpoint changes.
- Uses feature matching (SIFT), RANSAC, and image warping.
- Bonus: Forward panorama generation.

🔧 Requirements: `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `imageio`
📄 Includes: `ex4.py`, input videos, results, and visual demos

---

## 📁 Project 5 – Deep Style Image Prior
Uses a pre-trained StyleGAN2 model to fix and improve face images.

- Tasks include:
  - GAN Inversion (reconstruction)
  - Deblurring
  - Colorization
  - Inpainting (filling missing parts)
- Uses latent space optimization to guide results.

- Run on Google Colab with GPU acceleration.
- Input images are pre-aligned for better results.

📄 Includes: Colab notebook, input/output images, and saved latent vectors

## 📝 Notes
- These projects were created for educational purposes.
- Most are run from the command line or via Jupyter/Colab.
- Each folder contains code, examples, and short reports.

Feel free to explore, reuse, or adapt parts of the code for your own projects!
