Deep Style Image Prior – Exercise 5

This project uses a pre-trained StyleGAN2 model to perform several image reconstruction tasks.
It was completed as part of an image processing course. The main idea is to use the generator's learned
 knowledge of human faces to fix or improve images through latent space optimization.

What the project does:

1. GAN Inversion – Reconstructs an input face image by finding a matching latent vector that the generator
can use.
2. Image Deblurring – Takes a blurry image and produces a sharper, more natural-looking version.
3. Image Colorization – Adds realistic color to grayscale face images.
4. Image Inpainting – Fills in missing or masked parts of an image based on the generator’s learned patterns.

The project was done using Google Colab, with GPU acceleration, and is based on a StyleGAN2 model trained on
 the FFHQ face dataset.

All input images are aligned before processing to match the dataset format the GAN was trained on. Results
 depend on the quality of input and how close it is to the training domain.

Each reconstruction task saves its results and the corresponding latent code for reproducibility.

This repository includes the notebook, aligned input images, output results, and saved latent vectors
(as .npz files).
