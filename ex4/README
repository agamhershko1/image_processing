Stereo Mosaicing - Image Processing Exercise 4 (Course 67829)

Overview

This project implements the Stereo Mosaicing algorithm as part of Exercise 4 in the Image Processing course (67829). The algorithm constructs panoramas from videos captured with varying viewpoints or dynamic scenes.

The goal is to create stitched panoramas by aligning and blending frames extracted from input videos, handling both viewpoint changes and dynamic objects.

Features

- Extraction of frames from input video files
- Detection and matching of keypoints using SIFT
- Robust homography estimation using RANSAC
- Image warping and stitching for panorama creation
- Handling of:
  - Dynamic panoramas (moving objects)
  - Viewpoint panoramas (camera viewpoint changes)
- Bonus: Forward panorama implementation

Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV (opencv-python==4.11.0.86)
- NumPy (numpy==2.0.2)
- imageio (imageio==2.36.1)

Install dependencies via:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the script with the input video path and desired output directory.

Example:

python ex4.py --input input_video.mp4 --output ./results/

Code

All implementation is contained in the single script:

- ex4.py

Results

- Generated panoramas and intermediate images are saved in the output directory.
- Videos demonstrating results for both dynamic and viewpoint panoramas are included in the submission.
